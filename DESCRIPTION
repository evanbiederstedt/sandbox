Description: Functions for wrangling, processing and visualizing scRNA-seq data.
    This package was significantly slimmed down compared to scABC because many of the
    functions for the plotting of reduced dimensions were put into their own packages.
    Also, scABC2 only supports SingleCellExperiment object, not SingleCellExpressionSet objects.
